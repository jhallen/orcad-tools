- Add mark to indicate sheet is modeled by something else so that it will
  not be generated- something like '|modeled'

    Wires get a page number post-fix.
    Inter-sheet connections are by port.

- Primitive resistor port name starts with a number which is an invalid
  verilog name.

- Optional: add flattener

- Optional: add verilog net reader

- Optional: .INF builder from ASCII schematics (so that no OrCAD tools are
  used).
